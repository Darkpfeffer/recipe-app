# Recipe App

Website link: https://darkpfeffer-recipe-app-de79ad8bffee.herokuapp.com/

## Description
This application is designed so users can share, search, and read each other's recipes.

Currently, only the name of the recipe, the cooking time, ingredients, creator, and pictures can be added as information.
Users can:
- Register
+ Login
+ Delete profile
+ Surf through all the recipes, create their own recipes, edit, and delete self-made recipes
+ See diagrams about recipe data

The user, recipe, and ingredient database are linked to each other so that the users don’t have to specify every detail of the ingredient every time.

So far, the ingredients can be edited only by admins, because they are accessible for everyone. New ingredients can be created by every user. The “Future plans” section contains changes with ingredient editing.

## Note

Pictures are temporarily unavailable.

## Future plans
Ingredient prices will be editable after suggestions
Visual updates
Possibility for users to add recipes to their favorites

Calculating recipe price based on the ingredients and their quantities

Users will be able to copy(fork) a recipe and adjust the ingredients and quantities to their taste
